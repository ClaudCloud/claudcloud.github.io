                <p tabindex=0 >The world of Jutsu Kaisen is set in our own modern world, however there are things called curses made of negative emaotions from humans.
                    Curses are made of that "curse energy" from concentrated emotions, but they are invisible to the human eyes unless they are born with that ability to see them. 
                    If someone was able to see them, they would see monstrous looking creatures that wish to destroy. The more powerful the curse, the more damage or harm they can cause
                    to humans or the world. For example, a low-level curse could give aches to someone when they are nearby or more depressed. A higher level curse have the ability to 
                    take someone's life or even destroy cities... Which is where Jujutsu sorcerers come in. 
                    <br><br>
                    Justsu sorcerers are human born with the ability use curse energy and destroy curses. Using either curse tools or their own curse energy, sorcerers are in high 
                    demand by the government and instituitions to help defeat these curses. They have been around for ages, even when normal humans don't know anything about them. 
                    <b>Gojo Satoru is known to be the strongest sorcerer of today.</b>

                <p tabindex=0>In canon, the world's balance shifted when Gojo Satoru was born. He was the first sorcerer to have been born with two very rare and special techniques/powers.
                    He was born with powers called Six Eyes and Limitless. Being last of his clan, he also comes from a very influencial family in the Jujutsu world. Growing up, there was a 
                    lot of expectations put on him, his home life with his clan was not fun or a good one, so when he finally was able to leave home at 15, he did. Gojo then attended a boarding 
                    high school called Jujutsu Tech.
